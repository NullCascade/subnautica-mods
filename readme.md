# NullCascade's Subnautica Mods

## DataCustomizer

- Download: [GitHub](https://github.com/NullCascade/subnautica-mods/raw/master/Releases/DataCustomizer%20v1.0.0.7z)
- Requires: [BepInEx](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/1108), [SMLHelper](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113)

This is a json-supporting content patcher to tide me over until CustomCraft gets updated for the Living Large patch. It loads files in the data folder, and edits items as appropriate. Examples are available in the [DataCustomizer Mods](https://github.com/NullCascade/subnautica-mods/tree/master/DataCustomizer%20Mods) directory. This comes with files based on [Realistic Recipes and Increased Difficulty](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/88?) and [Fragment Requirement Booster](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/193?).
